>> ### Bisection Method
>> The program inputs the intervals and gives the root of the equation as outputs. The function for which the roots are determined is defined at the top of the program. <br>

>> ### Newton-Raphson Method
>> The program inputs a single guess and give the roots of the function defined as output. This method requires both the function and derivative of that function to be defined in the program. <br>

>> ### Secant Method
>> The program inputs two guesses and gives the root of the equation as outputs. The function for which the roots are determined is defined at the top of the program. <br>

>> ### Projectile Motion
>> The program inputs the initial velocity and angle of launch (degrees) of the object then outputs the Trajectory plot, Distance travelled vs Time and Height acheived vs Time. The program also outputs the Range, Maximum Height and TIme of Flight of the oject. <br>

>> ### Floating Depth of a Homogeneous Sphere in a Fluid
>> The program inputs the raidus of sphere, densities of sphere & fluid; then outputs the depth to which the object will sink in that fluid. <br>
