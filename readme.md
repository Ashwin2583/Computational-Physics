>> ### Bisection Method
>> The program inputs the intervals and gives the root of the equation as outputs. The function for which the roots are determined is defined at the top of the program. <br>

>>
>> ### Newton-Raphson Method
>> The program inputs a single guess and give the roots of the function defined as output. This method requires both the function and derivative of that function to be defined in the program. <br>

>> ### Secant Method
>> The program inputs two guesses and gives the root of the equation as outputs. The function for which the roots are determined is defined at the top of the program. <br>
